Developed a robust video analysis service that efficiently detects and timestamps faces within video frames. By leveraging OpenCV and face recognition technologies, the service delivers accurate face detection. Performance was significantly enhanced through the implementation of concurrent processing, allowing for faster frame analysis and enabling real-time video processing. The service was designed to be adaptable for a wide range of video analysis requirements, providing flexibility to meet various use cases.
